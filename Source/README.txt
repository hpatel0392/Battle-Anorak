Project no: 6

Project due date: Wednesday, December 13, 2017

Project description:
	Control Wade Watts' robot "Leopardon" as you fly around the battle at
	Castle Anorak and fight against Mechagodzilla.
	The battle for the crystal gate has begun....

        New this project:
	-------------------
	- g for Godmode
	- r for Reset
	- Fading in conclusion screen based on a win/loss saying "you win" or "game over" respectively
	- sounds are in
	- healthbars for player and boss
	- "fuzzified" the boss bullet trajectories to have a more interesting/natural spread
	- fine tuning of xml parameters

        Also the video is in the frames folder, titled harshp.mp4

The easiest part of this project:
    Adding the health bars and tuning xml params

Problems that I had in completing this project:
    oddly enough, implementing reset. The singletons don't get deleted when engine is deleted so you
    have leftovers from the previous run and it caused problems with invisible bullets and collisions.
    fixed it but was a little annoying to determine the problem.
